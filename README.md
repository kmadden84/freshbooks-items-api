# FRESHBOOKS ITEMS API/DATABSE

A simple API built with Node.js, Express and Sequelize.  Returns data from an "Items" table, with Name, Description, and Quantity Fields.
This API is called via the front-end React client, then compared against Items pulled from FreshBooks' API.  For any item in this database which has the same
Name as one in the FreshBooks database, the FreshBooks databse item will be updated with the quantity from this databse.
